			<div class="storycap">
				<p>Nakaseke Community radio hosted two women entrepreneurs to share their success stories. Among them is Nalubwama Dorcas on the left and this is how she said about her journey to success hence becoming one of the most prominent entrepreneurs in Nakaseke District.<br/>
				Mrs. Dorcas said that she is married and now has 3 children, a designer and decorator, has a Saloon in Nakaseke Town and is a good Hair styler, also owns a garden somewhere in Nakaseke Town Council <strong>Romans Garden</strong> which have the following services; <span class="more" id="view" onclick="seeText()"> read more</span></p>

						<ul>
							<li>Guest House</li>
							<li>Bar and Restaurant</li>
							<li>Conference Hall</li>
							<li>Space for Ceremonies</li>
						</ul>
					<p>Just like how Rome was not built in one day, also this took time for Nalubwama to make it and she passed through various different and difficult ways to reach her goals.<br/>
					She started as a charcoal burner in her home village ‘Kigegge’ struggling to get funds for tuition to learn how to style hair (Hair Dressing and Styling) hair for one year at a certain Big Saloon in Wobulenzi Town approximately 20 kilometers from Nakaseke District.</p>

						<p>Dorcas says that  was a first learner that she would learn a new hairstyles in just two days and this led her boss to give her a job even before she had not finished the course yet for 6 months.<br/>
						From there, Nalubwama was doing some saving and she came up with the amount of shs.70,000/= from which she bought a calf. She looked after it and when it grew to into a Big Bull, she sold it at shs.320,000/= and used the money to set up her own saloon at Nakaseke SSaza in Nakaseke District.</p>

							<p>Dorcas said that again from these savings she used it to opened up her second business of a boutique,a gardens, the bar & restaurant and many more... in Nakaseke District.<br/>
							Dorcas encounters challenges such as seasonable customers in the boutique and saloon, but this shortage is solved by the incomes generated from the other businesses.<br/>
							Nalubwama says that she can now able to provide her children’s needs, buy herself all what she wants and needs and also do train other people in the community who need to learn Hair Dressing and Styling. <span class="more" id="hide" onclick="hide()"> read less</span></p>
