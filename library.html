									Each Newsbook can contain maximum of newspapers of (3) three or (4) four Months and this depends to the volume of the copies were printed in a month.<br/>

				<p>E-Readers are rechargeable because they were designed with in-built batteries which take like two weeks without recharging them, this is really good because it makes the School Outreach Programs easy since they save power for a long period of time.<br/>
				The devices also have brightness (light) whereby a user can also use it in the darkness, user can change the level of the brightness depending on the current light if she/he wants.<br>
				User can also Bookmark and when comes next time continues reading from stopped last time, the devices also have a wide screen resolution which enables the user to see clear the contents.<br>
				Changing font size of the text is also there for the users who can see well small characters.</p>

			<p>Pupils also use these e-Books to do their home, after pupils get dismissed from the school in the evening they first visit the Telecentre before they reach home and access the devices to work upon their homework given by their teachers at school.<br/>
			Others they read stories and practicing to learn languages as well, many Pupils have liked and loved reading which has also led the number of users to increase due to the inspiration of the e-Readers.</p>

		<p>Kids and Children also they use the e-Readers since the Librarian is always there to teach them, instructs and reading with them.<br/>
		Adults, Teachers and Parents also they come to learn how to use these devices because a student may need assistance when is reading from school or home since e-Readers are also allowed to be borrowed.</p>
